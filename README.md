# Obsidian Meeting Note Plugin

After being frustrated of creating the same structure for every meeting, copy pasting content I decided to create this plugin.

## Setup  

By default the plugin uses the name `"MeetingNotes"` as the `Meeting Folder location`. You can change it in the settings to any name you like. The content of the created note can be changed through the settings. A default template is located in `src/util/constants.ts`.
`{{Date}}` can be used to get the current date.

## Demo  

When creating a file in the specified `Meeting Folder location`the plugin automatically fills it with a template for consistent meeting notes.

## Development

See [obsidian sample plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin#first-time-developing-plugins) for detailed instructions on setting up the plugin and making changes.

## Outlook

Some things I want to add:  

- Multiple names for the meeting folder
- ...?
